Install the [Grinch-Kernel](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/906018/jetson-tk1/-customkernel-the-grinch-21-3-4-for-jetson-tk1-developed/) for L4T Rel21.4

The **Grinch-Kernel** provides many useful drivers that **NVidia failed** to include in their stock kernel. :metal:

**Death-Note**: Do not update or install firmware using the package manager (**linux-firmware**) after or before installing the Grinch Kernel!!!!


Many thanks to the [jetsonhacks](https://github.com/jetsonhacks) group for providing a shell script for installing the Grinch Kernel.
The related shell script can be obtained from [here](https://github.com/jetsonhacks/installGrinch)
